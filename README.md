## Installation

To install and run the NIICS project locally or in your server environment, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or a local development environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP).
- A supported database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- Node.js or Python (depending on backend setup).

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the NIICS repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/niics.git
cd niics
```

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

#### For Node.js (Frontend and Backend in JavaScript):
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

#### For Python (If backend is in Python):
Install Python dependencies via pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Step 3: Configure the Database
Configure your database settings by updating the configuration file (`config/db_config.json` or `.env` file). Make sure the database connection is correctly set up.

- **MySQL Example**:
  - Update the `host`, `user`, `password`, and `database` in the `config` file.

- **MongoDB Example**:
  - Update the MongoDB URI in the configuration.

---

### Step 4: Run the Application

#### For Node.js Backend:
Start the server using:
```bash
npm start
```

#### For Python Backend:
Start the server using:
```bash
python app.py
```

---

### Step 5: Access the System
Once the server is up and running, access the platform in your web browser:
```
http://localhost:3000   # or the port specified in your configuration
```
